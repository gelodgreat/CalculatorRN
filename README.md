How to run:

1. yarn install

2. cd ios && pod install && cd ..

3. yarn ios or yarn android


Note: 
* There are some bugs on converting V, handled most of the issue but sometimes there are issues when transforming the whole computation
* I do like to input all the possible computation as far as possible so I choose to opt on showing the formula everytime you add computation symbols instead of computing it agains immediately, that would be much more simpler lol
